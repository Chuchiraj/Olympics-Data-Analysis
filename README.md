# Title: Olympic History Data Analysis Project
### Project Overview:
The Olympic History Data Analysis project aims to explore and analyze historical data related to the Olympic Games. By leveraging SQL (Structured Query Language), this project seeks to uncover valuable insights and trends from the vast dataset, which includes information about athletes, events, medals, countries, and more. The project will provide a comprehensive view of Olympic history, allowing for data-driven conclusions
### About the Dataset
Historical data on the modern Olympic Games, from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. We have two tables named as 'athlete' and 'regions'.
Each row of athlete table corresponds to an individual athlete competing in an individual event, including the athlete's name, sex, age, height, weight, country, and medal, and the event's name, sport, games, year, and city.
regions table consist of country level information corresponds to 3 letter NOC code in athletes table
### Project Objectives:
Acquire and load Olympic historical data from reliable sources into a SQL database
Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset's structure and characteristics.
Calculate descriptive statistics to gain insights into various aspects of the Olympic Games, such as the number of athletes, countries, events, and medals
Examine medal distribution across different countries and years.
Identify countries with the most medals and track their performance over time.
